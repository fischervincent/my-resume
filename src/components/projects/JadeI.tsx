    Jade-i was a small startup that developed software for conducting surveys on
    card payment devices post-payment.
    <br />
    I worked on the back office, enabling our clients to schedule questions and
    view survey results.
    <br />I also developed the software to display these surveys on three
    different devices: Ingenico Tetra, Verifone Engage, and Aevi SmartPOS.
