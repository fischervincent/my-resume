  <p>
    Netatmo is a leading smart home technology company. I joined motivated to
    deliver significant value to a vast number of users while tackling complex
    technical challenges.
    <br />
    <br /> I worked as a backend developer, in the Power Lighting and Weather
    team composed of 4 developers.
    <br />
    In addition to fixing bugs and adding features, I contributed to the code
    refactoring for clean architecture and best practices. I also did the
    technical analysis for a significant new feature in the Netatmo's business
    strategy: offline installation for professional installers.
