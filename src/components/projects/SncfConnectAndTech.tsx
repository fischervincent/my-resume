  <p>
    I worked as a backend developer for the very popular app Sncf Connect, the
    leading app for train booking in France, used by millions of users every
    day.
    <br />
    <br /> I worked on two projects.
    <br />
    <br />
    First I worked in a team focused on continuous improvement for
    short-distance trips (TER, Intercit√©s and buses), fixing bugs, improving
    performance and adding features such as displaying available seats. We were
    a team of 2 backend devs, 3 mobile and front end devs and 1 PO. The code was
    in javascript and kotlin.
    <br />
    <br />
    Then I moved to another team because their lead left. We worked on
    implementation of Taxi/VTC (ride-hailing) booking features for the SNCF
    Connect app. They had some 5 years old javascript code from the legacy app
    that they wanted to use, we had to migrate the features from the previous
    app to SNCF Connect, accommodating third-party changes, resolving
    performance and infrastructure cost issues, utilizing the SNCF Connect &
    Tech Terraform framework, transforming the code from a pure functional
    paradigm to procedural, and aligning with new user requirements.
    <br />
    <br />I decided to leave Sncf Connect & Tech for 2 reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>
        - I realised that I had no place in the future of the company because I
        was freelance, and because they wanted to stop using javascript for the
        backend and use only kotlin and containers.
      </li>
      <li>
        - Additionally, the project I was working on was unnecessarily
        complicated and seemed destined to take years instead of months,
        primarily due to the lack of functional specifications.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
  </p>
);
