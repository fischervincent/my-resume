  <p>
    I worked as a backend developer for the very popular app Sncf Connect, the
    leading app for train booking in France, used by millions of users every
    day. There are about 200 devs working for Sncf Connect & Tech.
    <br />
    <br /> I worked on two projects.
    <br />
    <br />
    First I worked in a team focused on continuous improvement for
    short-distance trips (TER, Intercit√©s and buses), fixing bugs, improving
    performance and adding features such as displaying available seats. We were
    a team of 2 backend devs, 3 mobile and front end devs and 1 PO. The code was
    in javascript and kotlin.
    <br />
    <br />
    Then I moved to another team because their lead left. We worked on
    implementation of Taxi/VTC (ride-hailing) booking features for the SNCF
    Connect app. They had some 5 years old javascript code from the legacy app
    that they wanted to use, we had to migrate the features from the previous
    app to SNCF Connect, accommodating third-party changes, resolving
    performance and infrastructure cost issues, utilizing the SNCF Connect &
    Tech Terraform framework, transforming the code from a pure functional
    paradigm to procedural, and aligning with new user requirements.
