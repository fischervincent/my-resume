      <p>
        My job is to <b>deliver great web apps or APIs</b>,
        <br />
        and sometimes I have to solve fun puzzles like:
        <br />
        “How do we spend more times working on features, and less times on resolving
        bugs or writing tests?”.
        <br />
        And “How do I reduce the response time without paying too much in infrastructure?”.
        <br />
        It’s so much fun to work as a team to figure out these issues and find solutions
        that work best for the project and the team, especially with the continuously
        moving ecosystem that is the web.
