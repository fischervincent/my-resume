      <p>
        My job is to <b>deliver great web apps or APIs</b>,
        <br />
        and sometimes I have to solve fun puzzles like:
        <br />
        “How do we spend more times working on features, and less times on resolving
        bugs or writing tests?”.
        <br />
        And “How do I reduce the response time without paying too much in infrastructure?”.
        <br />
        It’s so much fun to work as a team to figure out these issues and find solutions
        that work best for the project and the team, especially with the continuously
        moving ecosystem that is the web.

    The two most important things to me are UX and DX.
    <br />
    <br />
    UX because I want the users to be happy and satisfied with what we build.
    <br />
    DX because I want the developers to build a great product without pain and fast.
    <br />
    <br />
    I have {nbYearsExperience} years of experience building great and complex web apps and API with easy to read code, with 2 years as tech lead.
    My goal is for my team to deliver better and faster, without working more. It can be done by facilitating the communication, making the code bugproof, typesafe and more scalable with better tools and better code design, or by adding/removing some process to alleviate frictions.
